			<h1 style="color:#FFF">Dope Tech Profiles: Kyle Szalai</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF">From Zebra, to Eagle, to writing code. College graduate, Kyle Szalai is an excellent role-model, and huge inspiration to those wanting to become programmers in the far future.<br />
			Szalai went to Wayne Memorial High School, graduating class of 2012. He played Varsity Football and as well as Varsity Wrestling all four years, and graduated valedictorian. <br />
			“My experience at Wayne Memorial High School was very enjoyable,” Szalai says, “I did learn about myself while there. There are things I enjoyed, as well as things I didn’t enjoy so much, but I did learn a lot while there.”<br />
			In college, Szalai said he ran into a few problems in his process. “I understood the material just fine, but financial aid messed up when I became an RA.” This caused him to rush registering classes since there were multiple errors with that. <br />
			Szalai says that he has done things with computers his whole life, dabbling in Visual Basic while in middle school, and would write script that would type something into windows every ten seconds. <br />
			Szalai’s reason for why I went with computer science was because it allowed him to be creative with what he designs in software, and how he could apply his knowledge. <br />
			When asked about how he feels about being a huge inspiration to others, Szalai said “I am glad to be a positive role model to others, and I am more than happy to help in any way. I want to see my friends be successful, as I have been successful.”</p>

			<h1 style="color:#FFF">Rising of the Mirrorless SLR Camera</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF">You go out on a trip to a landscape in your town. You take all of your camera gear with you. Your DSLR, a large variety of lenses, your tripod, and all. You make the hour commute to the location. <br />
			You find the perfect shot. You set up your framing. You discover you need a longer exposure than normal. You set up a ten second timer on your camera. There is no way the shot can be ruined.
			You press the shutter, you step back, and you let the camera do the rest of the work. You take upwards of five photos, then you make the hour commute back home, and begin to review the pictures on your laptop. <br />
			You notice despite no shake, and a timer, the images are still not as sharp as you would like. The flip of the mirror shook the camera, making the images blurry.
			A mirrorless camera is just like a modern day DSLR, just without a mirror, it is all electronic. This saves a lot of space inside the body that camera companies take advantage of, such as Sony’s a7 II’s 5-axis image stabilization system, which has been complemented heavily by critics.<br />
			The mirrorless camera system is the future. They have many pros, and a heavily growing popularity due to their simplicity, their lightweight, and their easy to use interface.</p>

			<h1 style="color:#FFF;font-size:35px">Amazon Echo: Recommend or a Dead-end?</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF;font-size:15px;">The Amazon Echo. A $180 artificial intelligence unit released to the public, to act as a search tool, as well as a ordering tool, connected to your Amazon account.
	The Amazon Echo has been referred to as “Siri-in-a-speaker,” by those who have purchased it. It is extremely responsive and answers to the name “Alexa,” and will answer almost any question you have.
This device can control other smart devices you might have around your home, such as smart LED lights, smart TVs, and more! The sky's the limit!
	It is the competitor to the Google Home. It has its standalone app for iOS, as well as on the Google Play Store.</p>
			<a style="color:#FFF;text-align:center" title="Purchase the Amazon Echo!" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E6AO69U?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=88444290302&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4528845849925423848&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_5bkerg09re_e_yac_yfmrw4&th=1">

			<h1 style="color:#FFF;font-size:35px">Artificial Intelligence In The Consumer Market</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF;font-size:15px">A.I. or artificial intelligence is a growing market. It is an extremely interesting concept as well. Speaking with a non-living being that replies to most things you ask of it.
			Devices like your phone are examples of A.I.! Just like Siri, and Google Assistant, They are a large improvement from cybernetics in the late 1930s.<br />
			“A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers,” says the Merriam Webster dictionary on what an artificial intelligence is. An example of an artificial intelligence system is Cleverbot. A bot on a website, that is capable of holding a conversation with a human.
			A.I. systems are beginning to get more popular in the consumer market. Devices like the Google Home and the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, provide assistance in your home, by being able to control smart devices connected on the same WiFi signal, such as smart light bulbs, televisions, and more.
			People fear A.I. systems due to the myth of them revolting and controlling the world, having too much power. Bill Gates, Microsoft CEO even says that he fears how far computers and robotics are evolving.</p>

			<h1 style="color:#FFF;font-size:35px">Evolution of Programming: Past to Present</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF;font-size:15px">Programming. A large and growing industry. It interests many, as as well as confuses them.<br />
			Programming is speaking the language of a computer. Computers truly can do whatever you ask of them, speaking its language is the only catch in the system.
			There are multiple languages a computer can speak. The most common being Java. Created in Germany, and named after the developers coffee.
			In the 1890s, they would use punched cards to program. They would be mainly used for data processing applications, and previously, used for automated machines. 
			Six decades later, in 1941, the first language concept created was called Plankalkül, or Plan Calculus. Its main purpose was to represent geometrical structure. This idea later came to be in 1948, after six more languages were created.
			Programming is what makes up our digital world. There is a high demand for it, and it only keeps getting higher. It is the perfect career if you enjoy combining logic and creativity.</p>

		<div id="Opinion" class="container col-sm-8">
			<h1 style="color:#FFF">Operating Systems: Android vs. iOS</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF;font-size:15px">Simplicity. Customizability. Both popular. Which will help you get through the day?
			Android is the best choice. It is an excellent choice for the average consumer, and business person.
			It has an extremely lightweight and material design. It runs extremely smooth, no matter the device. Hence why it comes pre-installed on a majority of modern handsets.
			With Google Now, at your disposal, searching is as easy and quick as ever. With weather and traffic updates almost all the time, you will know how bad your daily commute is effected, even with alternate routes that will get you to your destination faster.
			People typically will respond saying “You can do all of that on an iPhone,” which is true, but looking at the price of an iOS device compared to the price of a solid android device is a huge margin. $400 for a high quality android device, $1000 for a brand new iOS device. Which would you choose blindly?
			Apple’s iOS does not match Google’s Android operating system close. There is a chance that can change in the future, but those chances are slim.</p>

			<h1 style="color:#FFF">NRA2 | Dropping the 3.5mm Headphone Jack</h1>
			<p style="color:#FFF">We here at NRA2 | Newspaper Lounge have seen a recent trend in cell phones dropping the 3.5mm audio port, also known as, the headphone jack. The alleged most important port in technology.
			We noticed this trend begin with the Moto Z and Z Force. Next up in that line being the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. We are all completely against this decision.
			This comes down to money, and convenience. The money people spend on headphones is surprising, Now they cannot connect their headphones to their device without bluetooth, or an adapter. Which bluetooth can be a pain to connect, and adapters will get annoying after awhile, and prevent charging and listening to music at the same time.
			People who enjoy listening to music on their daily commute are out of luck, they now have to invest in either USB to Lightning, USB to USB-C, or USB to Micro USB now, which are not difficult cables to get your hand on, but some vehicle radios don’t allow to play audio through USB, and the only pro is that your phone gets some charge to it. This is still not as convenient as plugging in the AUX cord, putting an artist on, then starting your commute.
			In conclusion, people need the 3.5mm headphone jack, It has become so essential to the portable device market, it is a horrible choice to get rid of.</p>
